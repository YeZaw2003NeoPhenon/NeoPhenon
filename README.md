- 👋 Hi, I’m @NeoPhenon(YE ZAW WIN)
- 👀 I’m interested in Software and Web Development
- 🌱 I’m currently fraternizing around with Java EE(Spring Boot) and HTML, simultaneously CSS with (Bootstrap-5) strap5 as well as one of the resplendent JavaScript library(React)
- 🤙 I’m looking to collaborate on some small project, With all due pretty diligent perspectives, Im genurinely obsessed with internship at Google.
- 📫 How to reach me is pretty ebulliently simple, just reach out to my GitHub account 
  - Pronouns: Learning programming languages is such sensationally sophisticated but why am I supposed to give up?
- 🧠🧠 Fun fact: I sometimes splash up some hours on Leetcode. I even get involved in brain teasing test with my peers.
