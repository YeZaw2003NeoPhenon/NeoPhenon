- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NeoPhenon(YE ZAW WIN)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software and Web Development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently fraternizing around with Java EE(Spring Boot) and HTML, simultaneously CSS with (Bootstrap-5) strap5 as well as one of the resplendent JavaScript library(React)
- ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some small project
- ðŸ“« How to reach me is pretty ebulliently simple, just reach out to my GitHub account 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Learning programming languages is such sensationally sophisticated but why am I supposed to give up?
- âš¡ Fun fact: I sometimes splash up some hours on Leetcode.
